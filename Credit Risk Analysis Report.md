# Credit risk classification:
## Purpose of this analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to build and evaluate a machine learning model for assessing loan risk in a peer-to-peer lending services company. The primary goal is to create a model that can effectively classify loans into two categories: healthy loans (label 0) and high-risk loans (label 1). This classification enables the company to make informed lending decisions and manage credit risk.
## Describe learning model's results:
### Balanced Accuracy Score:
>  The balanced accuracy score, which represents the overall accuracy of the model, is exceptionally high at 99.42%. This demonstrates the model's ability to make accurate predictions for both healthy and high-risk loans.

### Precision Scores:
>*  Precision for Label 0 (Healthy Loans): 100%
The model achieves a perfect precision score for healthy loans, meaning that it correctly identifies all healthy loans with no false positives.

>*  Precision for Label 1 (High-Risk Loans): 85%
The model exhibits a high precision score for high-risk loans, indicating that it correctly identifies 85% of high-risk loans with very few false positives.

### Recall Scores:
>*  Recall for Label 0 (Healthy Loans): 99%
The model captures nearly all actual healthy loans, with a recall score of 99%.

>*  Recall for Label 1 (High-Risk Loans): 99%
High recall for high-risk loans means that the model correctly identifies 99% of actual high-risk loans with very few false negatives.
## Summarize the results
The model's ability to accurately predict both healthy and high-risk loans makes it a valuable tool for making informed lending decisions and effectively managing credit risk. The model's precision and recall scores for both classes demonstrate its effectiveness in credit risk assessment. This tool can optimize lending practices and help the company maintain a healthy loan portfolio while minimizing potential losses associated with high-risk loans.
